    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>I don't think you guys understand, My mom LOVES Chicken. It has a choke hold over my family to the degree that the likes this world has never seen. Jerk chicken was her way of punishing her children for the sins of our ancestors. They call it Jerk because it bullies your mouth, takes it's lunch money, and leaves it crying pushed in a locker. Your lips will never recover, but they will come back. This is my moms famous Jerk Chicken recipe, enjoy!</p>
